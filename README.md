# Playground

The playground project is a repository of lessons and proof of concepts to share with others. Also to selfishly keep on hand wherever I go.

## Files

I've begun to separate projects into like solutions. If it's just a generic code example you might look in the Clients/Playground folder for console apps and unit test projects. Web projects are located in Clients/Web.Playground

* **Playground** - The root
 * **Clients** - User interfaces or presentation layers for examples
   * **Playground** - This folder contains mostly console applications and unit test applications for quickly testing simple little code examples.
   * **Web.Playground** - Various web applications with examples of the best practices I've found specific to web sites
 * **Data** - SSDT projects, database files or even local files. This folder contains anything you need to have in order to see the examples work with an underlying data source
 * **Stack** - A shared set of projects that are used to support the clients. Because the STACK projects are shared between all of the Client examples this reduces the amount of duplicate code
